Implemented a comprehensive FEDRAMP to gain expertise in federal cloud security compliance and navigated the complexities of FEDRAMP requirements, security controls, and compliance assessments. 

This FedRamp is done on a dummy company, which keeps the record of the Parole on the cloud server. This company tracks the activities of the Parole and updates the database.
